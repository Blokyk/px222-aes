-- The way the "key schedule" is implemented here is a bit different from the spec.
--
-- Basically, instead of generating an enormous array of all the keys we'll need and
-- doing every operation (including the expansion!) based on that big array, we only
-- generate one key at a time, and call 'nextKey' each round to get the next one. This
-- is because the core loop of KeyExpansion() only really depends on the `Nk` last columns,
-- i.e. on the last key; thus, we don't need to generate all the keys at once: we only
-- need to know the previous key we made!
--
-- The "price" we have to pay is to wrap the key in a tiny type that tracks the current
-- iteration/round we're on, which is needed for `rcons` unfortunately. Personally, I
-- find that it's still a lot cleaner than generating a massive array and indexing into
-- it each round. The other option would be to use something like the 'State' monad, to
-- store the current and future keys, and "consume/pop" a key each round, but this
-- turned-out to be a bit overkill and just made the code more confusing in most places.
--
-- This has the side-effect of slightly changing the semantic of the 'i' variable from
-- the spec:
--
--      - first, we chose to use 'i' to store the "original index" of the column, i.e.
--        the index of the column we're basing our transformation on
--
--      - using that property and the fact that we only depend on the last key to make
--        the next one, we can always act as if we're "generating/expanding the first one"
--        which means that 0 <= i < Nk (this has the consequence of making any 'mod Nk'
--        completely useless)

        -- Since for i > 0, we need the column we generated just before, we use
        -- mapAccum to "remember it" between each call. For i = 0, the "previous
        -- column" is just the last column of the key, so we use w[nk-1] to start.
        (_, newKey) = mapAccumL transformWithAcc (w (nk-1)) $ withIndex key

        -- This just calls 'transformCol' and puts the result into a tuple
        -- The first item will be used as the accumulator (i.e. prevCol) value
        -- in mapAccumL, and the second is the actual result
        transformWithAcc prevCol (initialCol, idx)
            = (newCol, newCol)
            where newCol = transformCol prevCol (initialCol, idx)

        -- Given the column right before it, the column in the original key, and
        -- its index, this will apply the right operation on it, which changes
        -- depending on the index.
        --
        -- NOTE: unlike in the spec, here the index is that of the original column,
        --       not the one we're currently writing; thus, it will always have an
        --       offset of Nk compared to "what it should be" if you're thinking in
        --       in the terms of the column we're writing (like in the spec.)
        --
        -- If you're comparing with the spec, here's a little rosetta stone:
        --      - prevCol = w[i-1]        (using the 'i' from the spec, not the 0-based one in c')
        --      - initCol = w[i-Nk]       (using the 'i' from the spec, not the 0-based one in c')
        --
        transformCol prevCol (initCol, initIdx) = c' initIdx `add` initCol
            where
                -- c' allows us to apply the "special treatment" we need
                -- to the words where it's needed depending on their index.
                --
                -- if i = 0, then `c' = SubWord(RotWord(prevCol)) + RCons[iter]`
                c' 0 = subWord (rotWordLeft prevCol) `add` rcons iteration
